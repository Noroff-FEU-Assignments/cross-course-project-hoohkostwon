## Description

This is the first project created during my studying of the front-end at Noroff. In this project, I was asked to create an online shop selling men's and women’s rain jackets. The main features of this site can be summarized below: 
•	The target audience: Men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, and canoeing. 
•	Unique selling points: The jackets are mid-range in price and emphasize durability and being suitable for a range of different weather types ensuring customers are comfortable whatever adventure they go on.
•	The site architecture: 
o	Home
o	List of Jackets
o	A jacket-specific page showing the jacket (product details such as the description of the product, price, and add to cart button)
o	A checkout page
o	A checkout success
o	About
o	Contact
•	The site is adapted to mobile, tablet and desktop
